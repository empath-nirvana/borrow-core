# Borrow core — specification

Version 0.3 · 2026-09-25

The library — `Paper/`, `Support/`, `Examples/` — implements this document and nothing else. A
change to the language is a new entry here, written before any code; the library then
implements it, and code an entry adds or changes is tagged `[spec §N]`. Experiments live
in `experiments/`, which the library never imports; work from one lands in the library only
after its entry is written.

Notation follows Wagner, Gierczak, Marshall, Li and Ahmed, *From Linearity to Borrowing*
(PACMPL 9:OOPSLA2:415, 2025): `[CONF]` is the paper, `[TR]` its supplement.

---

## 1. Baseline

The calculus is BoCa with the logic BoLo, as mechanized in *bolo-formalization*
(github.com/empath-nirvana/bolo-formalization, commit `1658da9`). This repository starts from
that commit's `Paper/`, `Support/` and `docs/`: `Paper/INDEX.md` indexes the paper's results and
definitions, and `docs/adjudications.md` records every departure from the printed text. That
fixes:

- **Syntax** — `[TR]` §1: values, expressions, types `1`, `⊕`, `⊗`, `⊸`, `Ref`, `Imm @a`,
  `Mut @a`, `[@a]`, `∀'a ⊏ @b`, `Unk`.
- **Typing** — `[TR]` p. 2's rules and p. 3's axiom table, read under p. 2's presuppositions
  (`DerivesWf`).
- **Machine** — `[TR]` §3 with the frames `K; e` and `injᵢ K` (`BoLo.Steps`).
- **Semantics** — the typed world: `[TR]` §§4–6 with the definition changes recorded in
  bolo-formalization's `docs/adjudications.md` §12.66–§12.73 (`vX`, `wpTS`, `SemX`).

Baseline theorems, which every later entry must preserve:

- **Fundamental Property** — `DerivesWf Δ Γ e T → Δ.Ok → Ctx.ScopedB Δ Γ → SemX Δ Γ e T`.
- **Adequacy** — `DerivesWf ∅ [] e 1 → Steps ∅ e ∅ ()`: a closed program typed at `1` has a
  run to `()` that leaves memory empty.

---

## 2. Entry 1 — the exponential, `!T`

### Motivation

`Imm̲ 'b (T₁ ⊸ T₂) ≜ Unk` and `Imm̲ 'b (∀'a ⊏ @b. T) ≜ Unk` (`[CONF]` Fig. 8 clauses (4), (8)):
an immutably borrowed function can only be forgotten, because it may capture linear
resources. With closure conversion a closure is a pair of its environment and code. The
environment is data, which `Imm̲` already views correctly; what is missing is a way to say the
code captures nothing, so that a borrow can keep it whole.

The paper names the construct: *"Linear type systems are often presented with an exponential
modality, `!T` … Exponentials are therefore an orthogonal extension that we will not develop
in this paper, though they are completely compatible with our type system"* (`[CONF]` 415:4).
BoLo has the matching connective, `!P ≜ emp ∧ P` (`[TR]` p. 6; definition row 5.38).

### Types

    T ::= … | !T

Scoping, well-formedness, lifetime substitution and `TyEq` treat `!T` as a unary former over
`T`.

### Metafunction and outlives

    Imm̲ 'b (!T) ≜ !T
    ─────────────
    Δ ⊢ !T ⊐ @a            (at every @a)

### Typing

`!Γ` means every live slot of `Γ` has a `!`-type (`Ctx.Persistent`).

    !Γ    Δ ⊢ T₁    Δ; x : T₁, Γ ⊢ e : T₂
    ─────────────────────────────────────  !I-λ
        Δ; Γ ⊢ λx.e : !(T₁ ⊸ T₂)

    !Γ    'a ∉ dom(Δ)    Δ ⊧ @b    Δ, 'a ⊏ @b; Γ ⊢ e : T
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────  !I-Λ
             Δ; Γ ⊢ Λ.e : !(∀'a ⊏ @b. T)

    Δ; Γ ⊢ e : !T
    ─────────────  !E
    Δ; Γ ⊢ e : T

Axioms, at a dead context:

    copy   : !T ⊸ !T ⊗ !T
    forget : !T ⊸ 1

Promotion is for `λ` and `Λ` only: an arbitrary term can allocate (`alloc ()` in an empty
context must not have type `!(Ref 1)`). No new terms and no new machine rules.

### Semantics

- Literal relation: `𝒱⟦!T⟧δ(v) ≜ !𝒱⟦T⟧δ(v)`, that is `𝒱⟦T⟧δ(v)` at resource `∅`.
- Typed world: `vX b (!T) ls δ v ρ ≜ ρ = ∅ ∧ vX true T ls δ v ρ`, in **both** modes: the
  observable view does not relax `!T` (it relaxes `⊸` and `∀`, §12.69).
- Shape: `vShape (!T) ≜ emp`. `tyLife (!T) ≜ free`.

### Retired

The literal-relation Fundamental Property (`[TR]` 6.151 at `Sem` under `WithloadEscrow`, and
`ViewWitness.fundamentalProperty_refused`) is not carried: it quantifies over `DerivesWf`, which
now includes the `!` rules. `Sem` at a `withload` node (`ViewWitness.withloadSem_refused`) and
the other literal readings in `Paper/LiteralReadings/` are kept.

### Obligations

1. The Fundamental Property and adequacy of §1 over the extended judgment —
   `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.fundamentalProperty`, `adequacy`; the new cases are `bangLamI_compatX`,
   `bangAllI_compatX`, `bangE_compatX`, `copyBang_compatX`, `forgetBang_compatX`
   (`Support/TypedWorld/Compatibility.lean`), over `gSepX_persistent` (`!Γ` holds `∅`).
2. `[TR]` 6.60 at `!T` (`vDen_outlives`, `vX_outlives`): the resource is `∅`.
3. `[TR]` 6.131 at `!T`: `[α] 𝒱⟦!T⟧ ⊨ ↺α 𝒱⟦!T⟧` — `reborrow_vDen`'s `!` case, by
   `reborrow_self_of_imm` (`Support/Model/Unr.lean`).
4. Programs (`Examples/`), each with its adequacy instance and an interpreter run:
   - `callBorrowed` — `λx.x : !(1 ⊸ 1)` loaded through an `Imm` borrow and called;
   - `captures` — a closure over an `Imm` borrow, loaded through a second borrow, called twice;
   - `fnMut` — state-passing `!` code run twice on a `Mut` borrow of its environment;
   - `ownedFn` — a closure owning its environment, with code `!(∀'c ⊏ ⊤. (Imm 'c 1 ⊗ 1) ⊸ 1)`,
     loaded through an `Imm` borrow and called twice;
   - `mutClosure` — a whole closure `(env, !code)` borrowed mutably and run twice.

### Closures, in these terms

| Rust | here |
|---|---|
| `fn` item | `!(T₁ ⊸ T₂)` |
| `FnOnce` | `T₁ ⊸ T₂`, or `(env, code)` consumed |
| `FnMut` | `(env, !code)` behind a `Mut` borrow, `code : !(E ⊗ T₁ ⊸ E ⊗ T₂)`, run by `withswap` |
| `Fn` | `(env, !code)` behind an `Imm` borrow, `code : !(∀'c. Imm̲ 'c E ⊗ T₁ ⊸ T₂)` |

### Why `!`, and not a closure former

The typed world chooses each reborrow's image from types (§12.69, §12.71). A closure's image
must be its captured resource, and neither its type nor its value determines that. Packing the
environment existentially does not link the image to the escrow, and neither does naming the
environment's type while its value is free (both refuted in the experiment
`experiments/BorrowedClosures/EnvCheck.lean`). `!T` has image `∅`, which is determined.

### Open

- **Promotion at every value.** Needs `wp` at a value to leave the resource in place; not proved.
- **Conservative extension.** Every baseline derivation is a derivation here and means the
  same thing. `DerivesWf` only gains constructors and `vX` is unchanged at `!`-free types, but no
  theorem states it: stating it needs the baseline and this library in one environment.

---

## 3. Entry 2 — the call-by-push-value core

### Motivation

BoLo is call-by-value: effects, thunks and data share one type language. Splitting value types
from computation types makes the shifts explicit, which is where closures are allocated and
data is materialized, and gives codata (`&`, and the formers of §7) a home.

### Types

    A ::= 1 | A ⊗ A | 0 | A ⊕ A | U C | Ref A | Imm @a A | Mut @a A | [@a] A | !A | Unk
        | X | μX. A                                                   (value types)
    C ::= F A | A ⊸ C | C & C | ⊤ | ∀'a ⊏ @b. C | D A | Str A          (computation types)

`X`, `μ` are §6; `D`, `Str` are §7.

### Typing

`CDerives Δ Γ e j`, with `j` either `val A` or `comp C`, over BoLo expressions in A-normal form:
the CBPV formers (`thunk`, `force`, `return`, `to`, `λ`, application, `⟨·,·⟩`, projections),
the lifetime `∀` (elimination at every `C`), the `!` rules of §2, `[]I` at every value type,
`⊑Imm`/`⊑Mut`, one constant per borrow axiom of `[TR]` p. 3 at arbitrary value-type payloads,
and three call-by-value derived forms (`lolliE`, `allEV`, `ofRet`). No new machine rules.

### Semantics

The typed world of §1, re-typed at `VTy`/`CTy`: `vC`, `cC`, `SemV`, `SemC`. `U C` is a leaf of the
record machinery (`Imm̲ (U C) = Unk`).

### Baseline, restated

- **Fundamental Property** — `CDerives Δ Γ e j → SemV`/`SemC` (`fundamentalC`).
- **Adequacy** — a closed computation at `F 1` runs to `()` and leaves memory empty (`adequacyC`).
- **Embedding** — `embed : DerivesWf Δ Γ e T → CDerives Δ (cbvCtx Γ) e (val (cbv T))` for every
  `DerivesWf` rule, so every baseline program is a program here and inherits adequacy
  (`adequacy_of_derivesWf`). "Preserving the baseline" means this embedding; the baseline
  theorem at `SemX` is not restated at `vC`.

---

## 4. Entry 3 — frame lifetimes are non-strict

`FrameLife`'s second conjunct becomes `x ⊑ α` (was `x ⊏ α`), and the reborrow step's premise
`W.InStratum β` becomes `StratumLe W β` (every lifetime of the world is at least `β`). The
typed world then admits views that last exactly as long as their frame. No current rule uses
this; it is kept for later same-lifetime views. From `experiments/Relaxed`.

---

## 5. Entry 4 — blocks, places and records

### Records and variants

A record is a binary tree of `⊗` (no trailing `1`); a variant is a nest of `⊕`. Both are derived
forms: construction, destructuring, projection, injection and case are derived rules, and `Imm̲`
acts fieldwise. Projecting one field of a borrowed record drops the other fields' views, which
must be `Affine`; `Affine` has no `μ` case, so projection past an unboxed `μ`-typed field is not
available (destructuring is).

### Blocks

`Shape ::= leaf A | node Shape Shape`. A block of shape `σ` is `size σ` cells, allocated at once.
Its handle has type `refTy σ`, defined as the family of its leaf references, so
`refTy (node σ₁ σ₂) = refTy σ₁ ⊗ refTy σ₂`: splitting a handle is the identity. An owned pointer to a
struct (`Box<struct>`) is the block form; the one-cell `Ref (A ⊗ B)` remains a separate type.
Blocks are allocated and freed whole (`allocS`, `freeS`).

### Family borrows

Several disjoint places are borrowed at one lifetime by nesting `withbor` and shortening with
`⊑Mut`/`⊑Imm`: `withborF2 : Ref A ⊗ Ref B ⊸ (∀'c. Mut 'c A ⊗ Mut 'c B ⊸ ['c] T) ⊸ …`, its `Imm`
form, and the block form `withborS`. A sub-family is passed on at the same lifetime. All are
derived rules. Restrictions:

- `withborF2`: the second leaf `B` and the result `T` outlive the outer lifetime (`VOutlives`).
- `withborS`: leaves and result are lifetime-free — built from `1`, `0`, `⊗`, `⊕`, `Ref`, `!`,
  `X`, `μ` (not `Imm @e`, `Mut @e`, `[@e]`; not derived, not known to be blocked).

### Open

- **Block provenance.** Leaves of two different blocks must not be joined into one handle, and a
  reuse hole (§6) must refill its own node. Neither is enforced by typing; the model is sound
  either way, but lowering a handle to one word needs it. To be settled with the syntax.
- **Variants in place.** A variant's layout depends on its tag; `Ref` does not distribute over
  `⊕`.
- **Same-lifetime views through a pointer** are excluded by the update relation
  (`experiments/FrameEnd`, `imm_view_rejected`, `mut_view_rejected`).

From `experiments/Records`, `Places`, `LeafPlaces`.

## 6. Entry 5 — recursive types and folds

### Types

`μX. A`, iso-recursive, with de Bruijn type variables. Positivity (`NoMut`): `X` does not occur
under `Mut`. `U C` is a leaf for type variables.

### Typing

`roll`/`unroll` on the same term (no machine step). `Imm̲` at `μ` substitutes the closed `μ` type
for `X` under `Ref`, `Imm`, `Mut`, `!` and keeps `X` at head positions.

### Folds

For `T` in the class `FShape` (closed leaf, `Ref X`, `X`, `⊗`, `⊕`; not `X` alone):

    foldImm   : !U(∀'y ⊏ ⊤. A_R ⊸ F R) ⊸ !U(∀'y ⊏ @c. Imm 'y (μX.T) ⊸ F R)     R outlives every lifetime
    foldOwn   : !U(A′_R ⊸ F R) ⊸ !U(μX.T ⊸ F R)
    foldReuse : !U(A″_R ⊸ F R) ⊸ !U(μX.T ⊸ F R)

`A_R` is the unrolled borrowed view with `R` at recursive positions; `A′_R` the unrolled owned
value; `A″_R` gives `Ref 1 ⊗ R` at each `Ref X` (the emptied cell and the result), so the result can
be built in place. `foldImm` terminates by the size of each view's witness, which is strictly
smaller than its parent's; `foldOwn`/`foldReuse` by the size of the owned resource.

### Semantics

`vC` takes a type-variable environment; `μ` is an impredicative least fixed point.

From `experiments/Recursion`, `CBPVMu`.

---

## 7. Entry 6 — codata: delay and streams

    D A ≜ νX. F(A ⊕ U X) & F 1          (delay)
    Str A ≜ νX. F(A ⊗ U X) & F 1        (stream)

Each has an observation and `close`; `close` is required because no rule forgets a `U C`, and
it releases a linear state. Both are interpreted as greatest fixed points; `delayIn`/`delayOut`
and `strIn`/`strOut` convert to and from the unrolling. Streams are built by coiteration:

    unfoldS : !U(S ⊸ F(A ⊗ S) & F 1) ⊸ !U(S ⊸ Str A)

### Loops

    fixD : !U(S ⊸ F(A ⊕ S) & F 1) ⊸ !U(S ⊸ D A)

The body maps a state to a result or the next state, and never observes the loop. Proved by
coinduction on the greatest fixed point.

### Adequacy

For every `n`, observing a `D A` at most `n` times and then closing it is a closed program; it
runs from empty memory and leaves memory empty.

### Open

- Non-tail recursion needs an explicit stack in the state, or a `bind` on `D` (not yet written).
- Whether `D`'s greatest fixed point equals the intersection of its finite approximations is
  reduced to one property of `wpTS` (`WpChainCommutes`), not derived.
- A general `νX. C` former is deferred; `D` and `Str` are fixed formers.
- Stream adequacy is stated generically only at `Str 1` (`take_runs`).

From `experiments/Recursion`, `CBPVMu`.

## Status

Entries 2–6 are implemented in the experiment `experiments/Core`, assembled from the experiments
named in each entry; it builds with one `fundamentalC` and `adequacyC` covering every rule. They
move into the library when `Core` is promoted.
