# Design decisions

Each entry: the decision, and why. Newest last.

1. **Start from the paper's calculus, not a new one.** Its semantic model already proves safety,
   leak freedom and termination without step-indexing; extensions are measured against it.
2. **Spec first.** The library implements `SPEC.md`; experiments live in `experiments/` and land
   only through a spec entry.
3. **Closures through `!T`, not a closure former.** A closure former's borrowed image is not
   determined by its type (refuted in `experiments/BorrowedClosures`); `!T` holds no resource.
4. **A call-by-push-value core.** Values and computations kept apart make codata, thunks and
   reification explicit, so the cost model can live in the types.
5. **Places by disjointness, not witness splitting.** Same-lifetime views through a pointer are
   excluded by the model (`experiments/FrameEnd`); borrowing disjoint places at one lifetime is
   derivable with no model change (`experiments/Places`, `LeafPlaces`). `split_at_mut` is a
   stretch goal.
6. **`Box<struct>` is a block.** A struct's handle is the family of its leaves, so field borrows
   and the fold rules apply directly.
7. **Recursion without step-indexing.** Inductive types by least fixed points, codata by greatest
   fixed points with a mandatory `close`, loops by `fixD` over explicit state; divergence shows in
   the type.
8. **Monomorphization, no type `∀` in the core.** Generics are definitions re-checked at each use.
9. **A structural core.** Names are abbreviations; nominal types and abstraction are a surface or
   module concern, via opaque types.
10. **Integers as term constants with a parametric host.** Nothing about arithmetic is proved:
    every theorem holds for every host, and compiler correctness will use the target's own
    operations.
11. **Persistent values are reused implicitly.** Types holding no resource may be copied and
    dropped by context splitting.
12. **The checker is derived from `CDerives`.** Every step applies one rule; incompleteness is
    listed once, never fixed by changing the judgment.
13. **Core syntax first, sugar from measured pain.** Sugar is syntactic, desugars before
    checking, and is not in the trusted base.
14. **A compiler MVP that keeps options open.** Uniform representation with exact memory
    accounting, explicit tail calls, per-stage interpreters, a backend-neutral flat IR, and
    wasmtime as the engine. Talos is deferred until its interfaces settle.
15. **Shallow handlers are primitive; deep handlers are derived.** A suspended computation is
    codata; one observation is a shallow handler, and a deep handler is a fold or a loop.
16. **Monads stay in the core.** The surface is direct style.
17. **A feature is done when it compiles.** Spec, core proofs, checker, lowering and a running
    corpus program, together.
18. **The LLVM path proves contract satisfaction, not LLVM's optimizations.** Deferred until
    there is an LLVM backend.
